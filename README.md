# Organize_Photo-Backups


### Libraries and versions
Created using Python 3.12.1

##### Setup
Used 2 libraries requiring setup using pip:
1. pip install --upgrade pip
1. pip install pillow
1. pip install tqdm

### Why:
1. Photo backup storage can get out of hand quickly and hinder usage of applications such as gmail or apple services when space runs out. Due to limits on amounts of backed-up items, they are often organized in an order from largest to smallest file size or otherwise.
1. I wanted a way to organize videos and organize them quickly based on timestamp meta data or rename these photos to sort them easily in a single location in the future.
1. Creating a personal photo album structure for an external device using C++ and Python.


### Goal:

1. Sort, label, and rename large groups of photos and videos on an external storage device
1. Option to rename with date_timestamp at beginning of file name
1. Option to create Year and or Month folders and sort appropriately
1. Option for deleting photos duplicate photos after copy
