# Organize_Photo-Backups

1. Python
1. C++
1. Bash ???

### Why:
1. Photo backup storage can get out of hand quickly and hinder usage of applications such as gmail or apple services when space runs out. Due to limits on amounts of backed-up items, they are often organized in an order from largest to smallest file size or otherwise.
1. I wanted a way to organize videos and organize them quickly based on timestamp meta data or rename these photos to sort them easily in a single location in the future.
1. Creating a personal photo album structure for an external device using C++ and Python.


### Goal:

1. Sort, label, and rename large groups of photos and videos on an external storage device
1. Option to rename with date_timestamp at beginning of file name
1. Option to create Year and or Month folders and sort appropriately
1. Option for deleting photos duplicate photos after copy


C++, C, and Python Transactions:

Why would we do this?

1. Large, tested stable library written in c++
- Such as communication library or a library to talk to a specific piece of hardware

2. You want to speed up a particular section of your python code by converting it to C

3. Want to use Python Test tools to do large-scale testing of their testing of their systems.


Terms:
Marshalling:
- The process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for starge or transmission.

Types to convert:
- Integers: Python stores with arbitrary precision. C needs exact sizes, be careful when moving between languages so overflow in C doesn't occur

- Floating-point numbers: Python is more flexible, careful in C and C++ to stay in range

- Complex numbers: C has complex numbers, need a struct or class in the C code to manage them

- Strings: Tricky when creating Python bindings

- Boolean Variables: Supported in C, straight-forward


Mutable and Immutable Values:
